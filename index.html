          In this work a non-conservative balance law formulation is considered
          that encompasses the rotating, compressible Euler equations for dry
          atmospheric flows. We develop a semi-discretely entropy stable
          discontinuous Galerkin method on curvilinear meshes using a
          generalization of flux differencing for numerical fluxes in
          fluctuation form. The method uses the skew-hybridized formulation of
          the element operators to ensure that, even in the presence of
          under-integration on curvilinear meshes, the resulting discretization
          is entropy stable. Several atmospheric flow test cases in one, two,
          and three dimensions confirm the theoretical entropy stability results
          as well as show the high-order accuracy and robustness of the method.

          We introduce ClimateMachine, a new open-source atmosphere modeling
          framework using the Julia language to be performance portable on
          central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).
          ClimateMachine uses a common framework both for coarser-resolution
          global simulations and for high-resolution, limited-area large-eddy
          simulations (LES). Here, we demonstrate the LES configuration of the
          atmosphere model in canonical benchmark cases and atmospheric flows,
          using an energy-conserving nodal discontinuous-Galerkin (DG)
          discretization of the governing equations. Resolution dependence,
          conservation characteristics and scaling metrics are examined in
          comparison with existing LES codes. They demonstrate the utility of
          ClimateMachine as a modelling tool for limited-area LES flow
          configurations.

          Curvilinear, multiblock summation-by-parts finite difference methods
          with the simultaneous approximation term method provide a stable and
          accurate method for solving the wave equation in second order form.
          That said, the standard method can become arbitrarily stiff when
          characteristic boundary conditions and nonlinear interface conditions
          are used. Here we propose a new technique that avoids this stiffness
          by using characteristic variables to "upwind" the boundary and
          interface treatment. This is done through the introduction of an
          additional block boundary displacement variable. Using a unified
          energy, which expresses both the standard as well as characteristic
          boundary and interface treatment, we show that the resulting scheme
          has semidiscrete energy stability for the anistropic wave equation.
          The theoretical stability results are confirmed with numerical
          experiments that also demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the
          proposed scheme. The numerical results also show that the
          characteristic scheme has a time step restriction based on standard
          wave propagation considerations and not the boundary closure.

          Numerical simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip
          (SEAS) have made great progress over past decades to address important
          questions in earthquake physics. However, significant challenges in
          SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between
          earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture, and aseismic slip, and
          understanding physical factors controlling observables such as
          seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing complexity of SEAS
          modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify codes and advance these
          simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. In
          2018, we initiated a community code‐verification exercise for SEAS
          simulations, supported by the Southern California Earthquake Center.
          Here, we report the findings from our first two benchmark problems
          (BP1 and BP2), designed to verify different computational methods in
          solving a mathematically well‐defined, basic faulting problem. We
          consider a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike‐slip
          fault obeying rate‐and‐state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous,
          linear elastic half‐space. Sequences of quasi‐dynamic earthquakes with
          periodic occurrences (BP1) or bimodal sizes (BP2) and their
          interactions with aseismic slip are simulated. The comparison of
          results from 11 groups using different numerical methods show
          excellent agreements in long‐term and coseismic fault behavior. In
          BP1, we found that truncated domain boundaries influence interseismic
          stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture, and that
          model agreement is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes.
          In BP2, we found that complexity of fault behavior depends on how well
          physical length scales related to spontaneous nucleation and rupture
          propagation are resolved. Poor numerical resolution can result in
          artificial complexity, impacting simulation results that are of
          potential interest for characterizing seismic hazard such as
          earthquake size distributions, moment release, and recurrence times.
          These results inform the development of more advanced SEAS models,
          contributing to our further understanding of earthquake system
          dynamics.

          We present a numerical method for the simulation of earthquake cycles
          on a 1-D fault interface embedded in a 2-D homogeneous, anisotropic
          elastic solid. The fault is governed by an experimentally motivated
          friction law known as rate-and-state friction which furnishes a set of
          ordinary differential equations which couple the interface to the
          surrounding volume.  Time enters the problem through the evolution of
          the ordinary differential equations along the fault and provides
          boundary conditions for the volume, which is governed by quasi-static
          elasticity. We develop a time-stepping method which accounts for the
          interface/volume coupling and requires solving an elliptic partial
          differential equation for the volume response at each time step. The
          2-D volume is discretized with a second-order accurate finite
          difference method satisfying the summation-by-parts property, with
          boundary and fault interface conditions enforced weakly. This
          framework leads to a provably stable semi-discretization. To mimic
          slow tectonic loading, the remote side-boundaries are displaced at a
          slow rate, which eventually leads to earthquake nucleation at the
          fault. Time stepping is based on an adaptive, fourth-order Runge–Kutta
          method and captures the highly varying timescales present. The method
          is verified with convergence tests for both the orthotropic and fully
          anisotropic cases. An initial parameter study reveals regions of
          parameter space where the systems experience a bifurcation from period
          one to period two behaviour.  Additionally, we find that anisotropy
          influences the recurrence interval between earthquakes, as well as the
          emergence of aseismic transients and the nucleation zone size and
          depth of earthquakes.

          The Galerkin difference (GD) basis is a set of continuous, piecewise
          polynomials defined using a finite-difference-like grid of degrees of
          freedom. The one dimensional GD basis functions are naturally extended
          to multiple dimensions using a tensor product construction on
          quadrilateral elements. The GD basis can be used to define the
          solution space for a discontinuous Galerkin finite element
          discretization of partial differential equations. In this work we
          propose two approaches to handling complex geometries within this
          setting: (1) using nonconforming, curvilinear GD elements and (2)
          coupling affine GD elements with curvilinear simplicial elements. In
          both cases the (semidiscrete) discontinuous Galerkin method is
          provably energy stable even when variational crimes are committed.
          Additionally, for both element types a weight-adjusted mass matrix is
          used, which ensures that only the reference mass matrix must be
          inverted. We also present sufficient conditions on the treatment of
          metric terms for the curvilinear, nonconforming GD elements to ensure
          that the scheme is both constant preserving and conservative.
          Numerical experiments confirm the stability results and demonstrate
          the accuracy of the coupled schemes.

          We describe a set of benchmark exercises that are designed to test if
          computer codes that simulate dynamic earthquake rupture are working as
          intended. These types of computer codes are often used to understand
          how earthquakes operate, and they produce simulation results that
          include earthquake size, amounts of fault slip, and the patterns of
          ground shaking and crustal deformation. The benchmark exercises
          examine a range of features that scientists incorporate in their
          dynamic earthquake rupture simulations.  These include implementations
          of simple or complex fault geometry, off‐fault rock response to an
          earthquake, stress conditions, and a variety of formulations for fault
          friction. Many of the benchmarks were designed to investigate

          When nonconforming discontinuous Galerkin methods are implemented for

          A methodology for handling block-to-block coupling of
          nonconforming, multiblock summation-by-parts finite difference methods is
          proposed. The coupling is based on the construction of projection
          operators that move a finite difference grid solution along an interface
          to a space of piecewise defined functions; we specifically consider
          discontinuous, piecewise polynomial functions. The constructed projection
          operators are compatible with the underlying summation-by-parts energy
          norm. Using the linear wave equation in two dimensions as a model
          problem, energy stability of the coupled numerical method is proven for
          the case of curved, nonconforming block-to-block interfaces. To further

          the development of a provably energy stable coupling between curvilinear

          In computations, it is now common to surround artificial
          boundaries of a computational domain with a perfectly matched layer (PML) of
          finite thickness in order to prevent artificially reflected waves from
          contaminating a numerical simulation. Unfortunately, the PML does not give
          us an indication about appropriate boundary conditions needed to close the
          edges of the PML, or how those boundary conditions should be enforced in a
          numerical setting. Terminating the PML with an inappropriate boundary
          condition or an unstable numerical boundary procedure can lead to
          exponential growth in the PML which will eventually destroy the accuracy
          of a numerical simulation everywhere. In this paper, we analyze the
          stability and the well-posedness of boundary conditions terminating the
          PML for the elastic wave equation in first order form. First, we consider
          a vertical modal PML truncating a two space dimensional computational
          domain in the horizontal direction. We freeze all coefficients and
          consider a left half-plane problem with linear boundary conditions
          terminating the PML. The normal mode analysis is used to study the
          stability and well-posedness of the resulting initial boundary value
          problem (IBVP). The result is that any linear well-posed boundary
          condition yielding an energy estimate for the elastic wave equation,
          without the PML, will also lead to a well-posed IBVP for the PML. Second, we
          extend the analysis to the PML corner region where both a horizontal and
          vertical PML are simultaneously active. The challenge lies in constructing
          accurate and stable numerical approximations for the PML and the boundary
          conditions. Third, we develop a high order accurate finite difference
          approximation of the PML subject to the boundary conditions. To enable
          accurate and stable numerical boundary treatments for the PML we construct
          continuous energy estimates in the Laplace space for a one space dimensional
          problem and two space dimensional PML corner problem. We use
          summation-by-parts finite difference operators to approximate the spatial
          derivatives and impose boundary conditions weakly using penalties. In order
          to ensure numerical stability of the discrete PML, it is necessary to extend
          the numerical boundary procedure to the auxiliary differential equations.
          This is crucial for deriving discrete energy estimates analogous to the
          continuous energy estimates. Numerical experiments are presented
          corroborating the theoretical results. Moreover, in order to ensure longtime
          numerical stability, the boundary condition closing the PML, or its
          corresponding discrete implementation, must be dissipative. Furthermore,
          the numerical experiments demonstrate the stable and robust treatment of PML
          corners.

          We couple a node-centered finite volume method to a high order finite
          difference method to simulate dynamic earthquake ruptures along nonplanar
          faults in two dimensions. The finite volume method is implemented on an
          unstructured mesh, providing the ability to handle complex geometries. The
          geometric complexities are limited to a small portion of the overall
          domain and elsewhere the high order finite difference method is used,
          enhancing efficiency. Both the finite volume and finite difference methods
          are in summation-by-parts form. Interface conditions coupling the
          numerical solution across physical interfaces like faults, and
          computational ones between structured and unstructured meshes, are
          enforced weakly using the simultaneous-approximation-term technique. The
          fault interface condition, or friction law, provides a nonlinear relation
          between fields on the two sides of the fault, and allows for the particle
          velocity field to be discontinuous across it. Stability is proved by
          deriving energy estimates; stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the
          hybrid method are confirmed with several computational experiments. The
          capabilities of the method are demonstrated by simulating an earthquake
          rupture propagating along the margins of a volcanic plug.

          Great earthquakes along subduction-zone plate boundaries, like the
          2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-Oki, Japan, event, deform the seafloor to
          generate massive tsunamis. Tsunami wave heights near shore are greatest
          when excitation occurs far offshore near the trench, where water depths
          are greatest and fault slip is shallow. The Tohoku event, featuring over
          30 m of slip near the trench, exemplifies this hazard. Unfortunately
          the rupture process that far offshore is poorly constrained with
          land-based geodetic and even most seafloor deformation measurements, and
          seismic inferences of shallow slip are often nonunique. Here we
          demonstrate, through dynamic rupture simulations of the Tohoku event,
          that long-period guided waves in the ocean (specifically, leaking oceanic
          P-wave modes known as PL waves) can resolve the shallow rupture
          process and tsunami excitation near the trench. With predicted pressure
          changes of ∼0.1–1 MPa along most of the seafloor landward of the trench,
          and periods of several seconds, these PL waves should be observable with
          ocean-bottom pressure sensors and/or seismometers. With cabled sensor
          networks like those being deployed offshore Japan and in other
          subduction zones, these waves could be used to rapidly quantify shallow
          slip and near-trench seafloor uplift and improve local tsunami early
          warning systems.

          There is strong evidence that the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake
          rupture reached the seafloor. This is surprising since the shallow portion
          of the plate interface in subduction zones is thought to be frictionally
          stable, leading to the widely held view that coseismic rupture would stop
          several tens of kilometers downdip of the seafloor. Various explanations
          have been proposed to reconcile this seeming inconsistency, including
          dynamic weakening (e.g., thermal pressurization) and extreme stress
          release around shallow subducted seamounts. We offer a simpler
          explanation supported by two-dimensional dynamic rupture simulations of
          the Tohoku earthquake. Our models account for depth-dependent material
          properties and the complex geometry of the fault, seafloor, and material
          interfaces, based on seismic surveys of the Japan Trench. The fault obeys
          rate-and-state friction with standard logarithmic dependence of shear
          strength on slip velocity in steady state. In our preferred model, the
          uppermost section of the fault is velocity strengthening. Rupture
          nucleates on a deeper, velocity-weakening section. Waves released by deep
          slip reflect off the seafloor, transmitting large stress changes to the
          upper section of the fault driving the rupture through the
          velocity-strengthening region to the trench. We validate the model
          against seafloor deformation and 1-Hz GPS data. The seafloor
          displacements constrain the seismogenic depth and overall amount of slip,
          particularly near the trench. Our simulations reproduce many features in
          the GPS data, thereby providing insight into the rupture process and
          seismic wavefield. Sensitivity to parameters is explored through an
          extensive suite of simulations. Neither static seafloor deformation nor
          onshore 1-Hz GPS data can uniquely determine near-trench frictional
          properties due to trade-offs with average stress drop. While conducted
          specifically for the Japan Trench region, our simulations suggest that
          rupture to the trench in megathrust events is quite possible, even if
          velocity-strengthening properties extend tens of kilometers landward from
          the trench.

          We develop a stable and high-order accurate finite difference method for
          problems in earthquake rupture dynamics in complex geometries with multiple
          faults. The bulk material is an isotropic elastic solid cut by pre-existing
          fault interfaces that accommodate relative motion of the material on the two
          sides. The fields across the interfaces are related through friction laws
          which depend on the sliding velocity, tractions acting on the interface, and
          state variables which evolve according to ordinary differential equations
          involving local fields.
          <br>
          The method is based on summation-by-parts finite difference operators with
          irregular geometries handled through coordinate transforms and multi-block
          meshes. Boundary conditions as well as block interface conditions (whether

          The theoretical accuracy and stability results are confirmed with the method
          of manufactured solutions. The practical benefits of the new methodology are

          The governing equations for multi-phase flow in porous media have a mixed
          character, with both nearly elliptic and nearly hyperbolic variables. The
          flux for each phase can be decomposed into two parts: a geometry and rock
          dependent term that resembles a single-phase flux and a mobility term
          representing fluid properties and rock-fluid interactions. The geometric term
          is commonly discretized by two- or multi-point flux approximations (TPFA and
          MPFA, respectively). The mobility is usually treated with single point up-
          stream weighting (SPU), also known as dimensional or donor cell upstream
          weighting.
          <br>
          It is well known that when simulating processes with adverse mobility ratios
          SPU suffers from grid orienta- tion effects. An important example of this,
          which will be considered in this work, is the displacement of a heavy oil by
          water. For these adverse mobility ratio flows, the governing equations are
          unstable at the modeling scale, rendering a challenging numerical problem.
          These chal- lenges must be addressed in order to avoid systematic biasing of
          simulation results.<br>
          In this work, we present a framework for multi- dimensional upstream weighting
          for multi-phase flow with buoyancy on general two-dimensional grids. The
          methodology is based on a dual grid, and the resulting transport methods are
          provably monotone. The multi- dimensional transport methods are coupled with
          MPFA methods to solve the pressure equation.  Both explicit and fully implicit
          approaches are considered for time in- tegration of the transport equations.
          The results show considerable reduction of grid orientation effects com- pared
          to SPU, and the explicit multi-dimensional ap- proach allows larger time steps.
          For the implicit method, the total number of non-linear iterations is also
          reduced when multi-dimensional upstream weighting is used.

          We present a high-order difference method for problems in elastodynamics
          involving the interaction of waves with highly nonlinear frictional
          interfaces. We restrict our attention to two-dimensional antiplane
          problems involving deformation in only one direction. Jump conditions
          that relate tractions on the interface, or fault, to the relative
          sliding velocity across it are of a form closely related to those
          used in earthquake rupture models and other frictional sliding problems.
          By using summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference operators and
          weak enforcement of boundary and interface conditions, a strictly
          stable method is developed. Furthermore, it is shown that unless
          the nonlinear interface conditions are formulated in terms of characteristic
          variables, as opposed to the physical variables in terms of which
          they are more naturally stated, the semi-discretized system of equations
          can become extremely stiff, preventing efficient solution using explicit
          time integrators. The use of SBP operators also provides a rigorously
          defined energy balance for the discretized problem that, as the mesh
          is refined, approaches the exact energy balance in the continuous
          problem. This enables one to investigate earthquake energetics, for
          example the efficiency with which elastic strain energy released
          during rupture is converted to radiated energy carried by seismic
          waves, rather than dissipated by frictional sliding of the fault.
          These theoretical results are confirmed by several numerical tests
          in both one and two dimensions demonstrating the computational efficiency,
          the high-order convergence rate of the method, the benefits of using
          strictly stable numerical methods for long time integration, and
          the accuracy of the energy balance.

          front and limits slip velocities to ∼10 m/s, a bound expected to be

          in an elastic medium (Zheng and Rice, 1998), a consequence of strongly

          of self-healing slip pulses, is just barely possible. At higher
          background stress levels, ruptures are crack-like. This phenomenology
          remains unchanged when allowing for oﬀ-fault plasticity, but the
          critical stress level is increased. The increase depends on the extent

          unreasonably large stress concentrations in the vicinity of bends. Our

          are anticorrelated with the local fault slope. These accelerations and

          Truly multidimensional methods for hyperbolic equations use

          remove, or at least strongly reduce, the sensitivity to grid design.<br>
          We present a new upstream-biased truly multidimensional family of
          schemes for multiphase transport capable of handling countercurrent
          flow arising from gravity. The proposed family of schemes has four
          attractive properties: applicability within a variety of simulation
          formulations with varying levels of implicitness, extensibility to
          general grid topologies, compatibility with any finite-volume flow
          discretization, and provable stability (monotonicity) for multiphase
          transport. The family is sufficiently expressive to include several
          previously developed multidimensional schemes, such as the narrow
          scheme, in a manner appropriate for general-purpose reservoir
          simulation.<br>
          A number of waterflooding problems in homogeneous and heterogeneous
          media demonstrate the robustness of the method as well as reduced
          transverse (cross-wind) diffusion and grid-orientation effects.

          In this paper we investigate truly multi-D upwind schemes for simulating
          adverse mobility ratio displacements in porous media. Due to an underlying
          physical instability at the simulation scale, numerical results are highly
          sensitive to discretization errors and hence the orientation of the underlying
          computational grid. We use modified equations analysis to predict preferred
          flow angles on structured grids for several popular methods and present a
          conservative, multi-D framework for designing positive upwind schemes for
          general velocity fields. After placing the common schemes in this framework,
          we go on to develop a novel scheme with "minimal" constant transverse
          (cross-wind) diffusion. Results for miscible gas injection into homogeneous
          and heterogeneous media demonstrate that truly multi-D schemes, and in
          particular our new scheme, greatly reduce grid orientation effects and
          numerical biasing as compared to dimensional upwinding.

          The grid orientation effect is a phenomenon which leads to the
          computation of fundamentally different solutions on grids oriented
          diagonal and parallel to the principal flow direction. Grid
          orientation remains an important consideration for many practical
          simulation studies, and renewed interest in gas injection processes
          motivates the revisiting of this classical problem. In this article,
          we show that there are aspects of the grid orientation effect that can be
          traced back directly to the treatment of early-time, near-well flow
          and therefore have a major impact on adverse mobility ratio
          displacements such as miscible or immiscible gas injection. The
          details of this effect mean that any uncertainty quantification study
          should account for the interaction of the near-well heterogeneity and
          the grid orientation effect. We also show how two possible methods-a
          well-sponge method and a local embedding technique-are able to
          produce a solution largely independent of grid orientation for single
          phase two-component miscible flow. Both methods are versatile in that
          they can be implemented on general grid topologies. They are
          illustrated on Cartesian grids for both the standard quarter five
          spot problem with two different grid orientations, and a problem with
          a single injection well and two producing wells at different angles
          to the grid lines. Our results show that it is possible to reduce
          grid-orientation effects for challenging adverse mobility ratio
          miscible displacements with only local treatments around the
          injection wells.

          Modern analysis of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is usually
          based on a traditional least-squares fitting procedure. Here an alternative
          Bayes-Turchin method is discussed which has a number of advantages. In
          particular the method takes advantage of a priori estimates of the model
          parameters and their uncertainties and avoids the restriction on the size
          of the model parameter space or the necessity for Fourier filtering. Thus
          the method permits the analysis of the full X-ray absorption spectra
          (XAS), including both XAFS and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES).
          The approach leads to a set of linear equations for the model parameters,
          which are regularized using the `Turchin condition'. Also, the method
          naturally partitions parameter space into relevant and irrelevant
          subspaces which are spanned by the experimental data or the a priori
          information, respectively. Finally we discuss how the method can be
          applied to the analysis of XANES spectra based on fits of experimental
          data to full multiple-scattering calculations. An illustrative application
          yields reasonable results even for very short data ranges.

      <b>Numerical Methods with Reduced Grid Dependency for Enhanced Oil Recovery</b>.

        <font size="-1">
          In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in enhanced
          oil recovery techniques, such as gas injection and in-situ combustion,
          as the need to access a wider array of hydrocarbon resources
          increases. Along with this, CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration as a carbon
          storage mechanism is increasingly important. These subsurface flow
          problems can be physically unstable at the scale modeled. This means
          that the displacement front will generally exhibit an unstable growth
          pattern known as viscous fingering. When simulating these processes,
          numerical errors which can be strongly correlated with the underlying
          computational grid can trigger, or at least bias, the formation of
          these fingers in ways not dictated by the underlying rock properties.
          This can give rise to the so-called grid orientation effect, where
          varying the orientations of the computational grid results in
          convergence to fundamentally different solutions.<br>
          The interest of this thesis is the development of numerical techniques
          that reduce grid dependency for these processes. We do this in a
          manner that draws upon fundamental numerical analysis techniques in
          conjunction with a physical intuition about the underlying governing
          equations. The governing equations for subsurface flow are of a mixed
          elliptic-hyperbolic character; here we focus on the hyperbolic portion
          but seek methods compatible with general elliptic discretizations and
          computational grid topologies.<br>
          Some aspects of the grid dependency can be traced back directly to the
          handling of the injection wells. Perturbation created early in time
          and near the injection wells propagate into the interior of the domain
          setting up an initial biasing for the simulation. We demonstrate that
          the handling of injection wells drastically affects the final result.
          We propose two methods, a well-sponge method and a local embedding
          technique, which extends the well region based on near-well models.
          Both of these methods drastically increases the similarity between the
          solutions on different computational grids.<br>
          The numerical method used in the interior region can also have a
          significant impact on the computed solution. For multidimensional
          (multi-D) problems the structure of the numerical diffusion tensor
          creates preferential flow directions. These preferential flow
          directions can be strongly coupled to the grid, especially when a 1-D
          method is applied dimension by dimension. This motivates the
          development of truly multi-D transport discretizations that
          incorporate local flow information into the flux calculation. We
          develop a family of compact, upstream biased multi-D finite volume
          methods for 2-D simulation. The methods control the structure of the
          diffusion tensor and incorporate characteristic flow information
          through the use of a local coupling methodology based on interaction
          regions. The family of schemes is positive for linear equations and
          monotone for a class of scalar nonlinear equations.<br>
          Two multi-D schemes, tight multi-D upstream weighting and smooth
          multi-D upstream weighting, are proposed and analyzed. Since
          transverse diffusion largely controls finger formation in linear
          problems, a third scheme is proposed called the Flat Scheme, which has
          constant transverse diffusion. All the multi-D methods are appropriate
          for both explicit and implicit time stepping. The methods are applied
          to both miscible and immiscible displacement problems and
          significantly reduce biasing due to the grid as compared with the
          commonly used single point upstream weighting method.
